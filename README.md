# Course Scraping

## For the creation of DegreeViz

---

This is indeed rather complicated.
Alot of functions to break down.

I could make a substack post with a very nicely formatted markdown document.

first commit:

```bash
git commit -m"initialized repo for college_course_scraping, added README, .gitignore, and all python files"
```

scrapesemesterdata.py includes coursetype:

- Core,
- General Education
- Major
- Elective
- Opportunity

It scrapes all courses and seperates them by semester, primed for visualization with Excel, Matplotlib, or Mermaid.

# DegreeView College Course Scraping

This is the code I used to create all the content on a website I launched July 2025, DegreeView.
It provides visualizations and statistics on degree plans and college courses at UT Austin.

If anything is useful here, I think its the "theassetcontainment.json" file.
Oh yeah the asset is what I called all the links to all the degree plans at UT.
Why not use fun variable names lol.

scrapesemesterdata.py is also useful, that one was tricky to build fr.

You have to make the code account for all the many quirks of courses and the structure of the degreeplans at UT Austin.

### datavisualizations.py and dataviz2.py made charts

These files made the charts that are on the DegreeView UT stats page.

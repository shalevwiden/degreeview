## For the creation of DegreeViz

---

This is indeed rather complicated.
Alot of functions to break down.

I could make a substack post with a very nicely formatted markdown document.

first commit:

```bash
git commit -m"initialized repo for college_course_scraping, added README, .gitignore, and all python files"
```
